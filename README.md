Sure, here's the JIRA story for creating a new .NET Core solution and setting up authentication:

### Create a New .NET Core Solution and Set Up Authentication

#### Story (the Narrative)
As a developer, I need to create a new .NET Core solution and set up authentication to ensure secure access to the SharePoint Online (SPO) APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria/Test (the What)
- A new .NET Core solution should be created.
- The solution should include a project for the API.
- Authentication should be set up using OAuth 2.0 with Azure AD.
- The authentication setup should be tested to ensure it works correctly with a SharePoint Online site.

#### Dependencies/Constraints
- Access to Azure AD for registering the application.
- Access to the SharePoint Online environment for testing.
- Proper permissions to create and configure Azure AD applications.

#### Technical Details
- **Technology:** .NET Core
- **Solution Name:** `SPOContentAPI`
- **Project Name:** `SPOContentAPI.Web`
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 with Azure AD

#### Steps to Implement
1. **Create a New .NET Core Solution:**
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Run the following commands to create the solution and project:
    ```bash
    mkdir SPOContentAPI
    cd SPOContentAPI
    dotnet new sln
    dotnet new webapi -n SPOContentAPI.Web
    dotnet sln add SPOContentAPI.Web/SPOContentAPI.Web.csproj
    ```

2. **Set Up Authentication:**
    - Register the application in Azure AD:
        1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to Azure Active Directory.
        2. Select "App registrations" and click "New registration."
        3. Enter a name for the application (e.g., `SPOContentAPI`).
        4. Set the "Redirect URI" to `https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc`.
        5. Click "Register."
    - Configure the API permissions:
        1. In the registered application, go to "API permissions."
        2. Click "Add a permission" and select "Microsoft Graph."
        3. Select "Delegated permissions" and add the necessary permissions (e.g., `Sites.Read.All`).
        4. Click "Grant admin consent."
    - Configure the client secrets:
        1. In the registered application, go to "Certificates & secrets."
        2. Click "New client secret" and add a description and expiration period.
        3. Copy the client secret value (you'll need this for configuration).

3. **Update the .NET Core Project for Authentication:**
    - Install the necessary NuGet packages:
    ```bash
    cd SPOContentAPI.Web
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Web
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraph
    ```
    - Update `appsettings.json` with Azure AD configuration:
    ```json
    {
      "AzureAd": {
        "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
        "Domain": "yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com",
        "TenantId": "your-tenant-id",
        "ClientId": "your-client-id",
        "ClientSecret": "your-client-secret",
        "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc"
      }
    }
    ```
    - Configure authentication in `Startup.cs`:
    ```csharp
    public class Startup
    {
        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"));

            services.AddControllers();
            services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration);
            services.AddAuthorization();
        }

        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();
            app.UseRouting();
            app.UseAuthentication();
            app.UseAuthorization();
            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
            {
                endpoints.MapControllers();
            });
        }
    }
    ```

4. **Test Authentication:**
    - Run the application using `dotnet run`.
    - Test the authentication flow by accessing a secure endpoint and ensuring you can sign in using your Azure AD credentials.

This story outlines the creation of a new .NET Core solution and the setup of OAuth 2.0 authentication with Azure AD. Ensure all configurations and permissions are correctly set up in Azure AD and within the .NET Core project.
