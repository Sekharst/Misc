# SharePoint Online (SPO) API Development

This project aims to develop a series of .NET Core APIs for interacting with SharePoint Online (SPO) site content, specifically for validating site URLs, retrieving lists of libraries, folders, and subfolders, and downloading library/folder content.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Validate Site URL

#### Story (the Narrative)
As a developer, I need an API endpoint to validate that a given SharePoint Online (SPO) site URL is valid to ensure that subsequent operations can be performed on the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria/Test (the What)
- The API should accept a site URL as input.
- The API should return a response indicating whether the URL is valid or not.
- If the URL is invalid, the response should include an appropriate error message.
- The API should handle different types of invalid URLs (e.g., malformed URLs, non-existent sites).

#### Dependencies/Constraints
- Access to the SharePoint Online environment for testing.
- Proper authentication mechanism to access the SharePoint Online site.
- Network connectivity to the SharePoint Online site.

#### Technical Details
- **Technology:** .NET Core
- **Endpoint:** `/api/validate-site-url`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Input:** JSON object containing the site URL.
- **Output:** JSON response indicating validity and error message if invalid.
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 with Azure AD
- **Utilizes:** Microsoft Graph API or SharePoint REST API for site validation.

### 2. Retrieve List of Libraries

#### Story (the Narrative)
As a developer, I need an API endpoint to retrieve the list of document libraries for a given SharePoint Online (SPO) site URL so that users can select a specific library to perform further actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria/Test (the What)
- The API should accept a site URL as input.
- The API should return a list of document libraries available in the given site.
- If the site URL is invalid, the API should return an appropriate error message.

#### Dependencies/Constraints
- Successful implementation of the site URL validation API.
- Access to the SharePoint Online environment for testing.
- Proper authentication mechanism to access the SharePoint Online site.
- Network connectivity to the SharePoint Online site.

#### Technical Details
- **Technology:** .NET Core
- **Endpoint:** `/api/get-libraries`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Input:** JSON object containing the site URL.
- **Output:** JSON response with a list of document libraries.
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 with Azure AD
- **Utilizes:** Microsoft Graph API or SharePoint REST API to fetch libraries.

### 3. Retrieve List of Folders & Subfolders

#### Story (the Narrative)
As a developer, I need an API endpoint to retrieve the list of folders and subfolders for a given document library in a SharePoint Online (SPO) site to allow users to navigate through the folder structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria/Test (the What)
- The API should accept the site URL and library identifier as input.
- The API should return a list of folders and subfolders within the specified library.
- If the library identifier is invalid, the API should return an appropriate error message.

#### Dependencies/Constraints
- Successful implementation of the library retrieval API.
- Access to the SharePoint Online environment for testing.
- Proper authentication mechanism to access the SharePoint Online site.
- Network connectivity to the SharePoint Online site.

#### Technical Details
- **Technology:** .NET Core
- **Endpoint:** `/api/get-folders`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Input:** JSON object containing the site URL and library identifier.
- **Output:** JSON response with a list of folders and subfolders.
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 with Azure AD
- **Utilizes:** Microsoft Graph API or SharePoint REST API to fetch folders.

### 4. Download Library/Folder & All Its Children

#### Story (the Narrative)
As a developer, I need an API endpoint to download the contents of a selected document library or folder, including all its subfolders and files, from a SharePoint Online (SPO) site so that users can backup or transfer their data.

#### Acceptance Criteria/Test (the What)
- The API should accept the site URL, library identifier, and folder identifier (if any) as input.
- The API should download all contents of the specified library or folder, including all subfolders and files.
- The API should handle large datasets and provide progress feedback if possible.
- If the library or folder identifier is invalid, the API should return an appropriate error message.

#### Dependencies/Constraints
- Successful implementation of the folder retrieval API.
- Access to the SharePoint Online environment for testing.
- Proper authentication mechanism to access the SharePoint Online site.
- Network connectivity to the SharePoint Online site.
- Sufficient storage for downloading large datasets.

#### Technical Details
- **Technology:** .NET Core
- **Endpoint:** `/api/download-content`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Input:** JSON object containing the site URL, library identifier, and folder identifier (if any).
- **Output:** The downloaded content in a suitable format (e.g., ZIP file).
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 with Azure AD
- **Utilizes:** Microsoft Graph API or SharePoint REST API to fetch and download content.
