Here's a revised plan for decommissioning a SharePoint Online tenant, to be implemented after the completion of a migration process:

---

### **Post-Migration SharePoint Online Tenant Decommissioning Plan**

#### **1. Post-Migration Verification**
   - **Verify Data Integrity:** Ensure that all data has been successfully migrated and is accessible in the new environment.
   - **Confirm Functionality:** Check that all features, permissions, and integrations are functioning as expected in the new system.

#### **2. Stakeholder Communication**
   - **Update Stakeholders:** Inform all relevant parties about the successful completion of the migration and the upcoming decommissioning of the old tenant.
   - **Provide Support Information:** Share support channels and documentation for the new environment to assist users with the transition.

#### **3. Disable New Content Creation**
   - **Restrict Permissions:** Prevent the creation of new content in the old tenant by restricting permissions to read-only.
   - **Suspend Changes:** Halt any further configuration changes or development activities in the old tenant.

#### **4. Backup and Archival**
   - **Final Backup:** Perform a final backup of the old tenant's data, including sites, libraries, lists, and other critical content.
   - **Archive Important Data:** Identify and archive any important or legally required data separately, ensuring compliance with retention policies.

#### **5. Data Purge and Compliance**
   - **Purge Unnecessary Data:** Securely delete any data that is no longer needed or that has been confirmed as successfully migrated.
   - **Compliance Review:** Ensure all actions comply with regulatory and legal requirements, especially concerning data retention and deletion.

#### **6. Deactivate Services**
   - **Disable Integrations:** Turn off any integrations, workflows, and third-party services connected to the old tenant.
   - **Cancel Licenses and Subscriptions:** Review and cancel any remaining SharePoint Online licenses or subscriptions associated with the tenant.

#### **7. User Account Management**
   - **Revoke Access:** Remove access for all users, including external users, to prevent any further login attempts.
   - **Deactivate Accounts:** Deactivate or delete user accounts in the old tenant.

#### **8. Final Tenant Closure**
   - **Request Official Closure:** Contact Microsoft to officially close the tenant if this step is required by your subscription type.
   - **Verify Billing Cessation:** Ensure that billing for the old tenant ceases, and review for any potential outstanding charges.

#### **9. Post-Decommission Review and Documentation**
   - **Document Process:** Record the decommissioning steps taken, including any issues encountered and their resolutions.
   - **Report to Stakeholders:** Provide a comprehensive report to stakeholders summarizing the decommissioning process and final state.

#### **10. Long-term Data Management**
   - **Monitor Archived Data:** Set up a plan for managing archived data, including access controls and regular reviews for relevance.
   - **Plan for Future Needs:** Consider any future needs for the old data or configurations and plan accordingly.

This plan ensures a smooth and compliant decommissioning process, preserving necessary data while effectively shutting down the old SharePoint Online tenant.
