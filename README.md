#### Acceptance Criteria/Test (the What)
- Identify all pending Action Points (AP) related to the ETADE migration.
- Gather detailed information and evidence for each AP, including system logs, user feedback, migration reports, and any other relevant data.
- Document the status and resolution of each AP, providing clear and comprehensive explanations.

- Submit the compiled information to the relevant stakeholders for review and approval.

#### Dependencies/Constraints
- Access to system logs, migration reports, and other relevant documentation.
- Collaboration with team members and stakeholders to obtain necessary information.
- Proper permissions to access and review migration data.
- Alignment with the criteria and expectations set by stakeholders for closing the AP.

#### Technical Details
- **Technology:** Use existing tools and systems to extract and compile data (e.g., logging systems, migration tracking tools).
- **Data Sources:** System logs, migration reports, user feedback, project documentation.
- **Documentation:** Compile information into a structured report or database for easy review and approval.
- **Validation:** Cross-check gathered data against requirements to ensure completeness and accuracy.

### Steps to Implement

1. **Identify Pending APs:**
   - Review project documentation and communication logs to identify all pending Action Points related to the ETADE migration.

2. **Gather Information:**
   - Collect system logs that detail the migration process, focusing on any issues or anomalies encountered.
   - Obtain user feedback regarding the migration to understand any concerns or issues raised.
   - Gather migration reports and documentation that provide a comprehensive overview of the process and outcomes.
   - Collect additional evidence as needed, such as screenshots, error messages, or system metrics.

3. **Document and Compile Data:**
   - Organize the gathered information into a structured format, such as a report or database.
   - Clearly document the status and resolution of each AP, providing detailed explanations and evidence.
   - Ensure the documentation is thorough and meets the criteria for closing the AP.

4. **Review and Approval:**
   - Share the compiled information with relevant stakeholders for review.
   - Address any feedback or requests for additional information to ensure all APs are satisfactorily closed.
   - Obtain formal approval from stakeholders to close the AP.

This story outlines the steps required to gather and compile the necessary information and evidence to close pending Action Points related to the ETADE migration, ensuring that all issues are resolved and documented to the satisfaction of stakeholders.
